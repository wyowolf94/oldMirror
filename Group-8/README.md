**Project Name:** 
	Smart Mirror  

**Brief Project Description (Fall 2016):**
	We plan to build an initial smart mirror along with a mobile app that controls the content on the mirror. We are building the mirror off of a disassembled television using a raspberry pi. We will also be using Android Studios to program the mobile app. The mobile app will include options on which features to display and how to display them.  
	
**Brief Project Description (Spring 2017):**
	We built a mirror using an old TV and two-way mirrored acryllic. Pictures of the mirror can be found on the presentation slide deck provided in the Documents directory. The smart mirror runs off of an app on the raspberry pi running Nougat 7. The phone app is for android and was built based off of example code from the android class. The phone app runs mostly from main with a couple of helper classes that aren't nearly as involved.
